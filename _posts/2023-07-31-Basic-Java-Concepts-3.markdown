Before delving into the reservoir sampling algorithm, let's first understand some basic Java concepts related to random number generation. Having this knowledge will be really helpful before diving into the algorithm. Java offers two common methods to generate random objects: using a <span style="color:red">**pseudo-random generator**</span> and utilizing the <span style="color:red">**Math.random()**</span> method.

Java provides the _java.util.Random_ library and the _java.lang.Math_ class for generating random numbers. The former method involves creating a Random instance to generate random numbers, while the latter utilizes the Math.random() method, which generates a double value from 0 (inclusive) to 1 (exclusive).

#### Understanding the Random Library in Java

The Math.random() method is a static method provided by the Math library. It returns a double value ranging from 0 (inclusive) to 1 (exclusive) without requiring any input parameters. On the other hand, to use the Random generator, you need to create a Random instance before calling its methods. Consequently, you'll often see developers creating a Random object for random number generation.

Looking into the source code, you'll find that the underlying logic of Math.random() also involves creating a Random generator and calling the random.nextDouble() method to produce the random number. Therefore, in this blog, we will focus on generating random values using the Random objects.

#### Inside the Random Object Library

The **Random** object library provides two constructor methods. The first is the default constructor, while the second one allows you to provide an input seed. A seed is a value used to generate a random sequence. It's essential to note that if two Random generators have the same seed, all the random values generated by them will be identical.

The default constructor of the Random class employs the system's nanosecond value to generate the seed. Consequently, the random seed is generated based on the JVM's running time.

Here is the example:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Random random1 = new Random(10);
    System.out.println("Here is using one random object:");
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        System.out.print(random1.nextInt(10) + " ");
    }

    System.out.println();
    Random random2 = new Random(10);
    System.out.println("Here is using another random object:");
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        System.out.print(random2.nextInt(10) + " ");
    }
}
/*
Result:
Here is using one random object:
3 0 3 0 6 6 7 8 1 4
Here is using another random object:
3 0 3 0 6 6 7 8 1 4
*/
```

With this understanding of Java's random number generation, we can now proceed to explore the reservoir sampling algorithm, a clever technique to randomly select elements from a data stream with equal probability.
