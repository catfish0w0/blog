#### Introduction

Web development has come a long way since the early days of static HTML pages. Today, modern web development encompasses a broad range of technologies, tools, and practices that enable developers to build dynamic, interactive, and responsive websites and web applications. This field has evolved rapidly to meet the growing demands of users and to leverage advancements in technology.

#### What is Java Servlet??

Java Servlet is a Java programming technology that receives any request and returns in a response using related network protocols(for web applications, usually HTTP). It usually takes in a **Servlet container**, like Tomcat(blocking IO) or Netty(Non-blocking IO)...etc. When a client sends a request to the well configured servlet container, **the servlet container will invoke the corresponding servlet's methods, such as doGet() or doPost()**, based on the request type. After that, the servlet processes the request, generates a response, sends it back to the client, and makes the application functional.

Imagine a well-developed restaurant, the client side(frontend/UI) is the menu, the table, the seat, and the inside environment. The waiter itself is the Servlet that takes in any client's orders back to the kitchen. The kitchen is the server side that receives all the orders(HTTP request), cooks the recipe and returns the food(HTTP response) to clients.

#### Why do we need to learn Java Servlet?

It is because Servlet Technology is the low-level foundation for building dynamic and interactive web applications. Studying it can help us understand advanced technology, like other latest technology like Spring MVC, Spring Boot...etc. You will have to understand that starting with Java and plain Spring framework will pay for itself with a comprehensive understanding of the whole Spring Ecosystem, which Spring Boot builds upon.

Okay, I have done enough talking, let's jump right into the code.

#### Implementation
Let's create a new Project java EE. I am using Intellij as my code editor.\
Here is the basic project set up.

Remember to click the servlet button afterward.
