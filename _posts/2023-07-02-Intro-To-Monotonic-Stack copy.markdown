## What is monotonic Stack??

Monostack is a **Stack**. You are right, you did not hear me wrong. Monostack is basically just the data structure stack. It does not have any difference in implementation in code. The only thing that differs is the use of the Stack.

Monostack is a stack that follows specific ordering. To understand it thoroughly, it consists of 4 different types of monostack: increasing stack, non decreasing stack, decreasing stack, non increasing stack.

## What can monotonic Stack do??

It has 2 common uses cases

1. finding the next greater/smaller/greater equals/smaller equals element
2. finding the prev greater/smaller/greater equals/smaller equals element

For example: For example:
[3, 7, 8, 4]  
The previous smaller element of 7 is 3. The next smaller element of 8 is 4. <br>
The previous smaller element of 8 is 7. The next smaller element of 7 is 4. <br>
The previous smaller element of 4 is 3. <br>
There is no previous less element for 3. There is no next smaller element for 3 and 4. <br>

## When && Why do we have MonoStack??

Monostack exists because it utilizes the advantage of Stack on offering/polling/peeking top element in O(1) time Complexity.
and we can simply apply it based on this current usecase!
