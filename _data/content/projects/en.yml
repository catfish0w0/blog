        ### Paragraphs

        #### Paragraph

        **William Shakespeare**, Let me not to the marriage of true minds
        Admit impediments. Love is not love
        Which alters when it alteration finds,
        Or bends with the remover to remove.
        O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
        It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
        Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
        Within his bending sickle's compass come;
        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me proved,
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

        > **William Shakespeare**, Let me not to the marriage of true minds
        Admit impediments. Love is not love
        Which alters when it alteration finds,
        Or bends with the remover to remove.
        O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
        It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
        Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
        Within his bending sickle's compass come;
        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me proved,
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

        #### What is this project about?
        This project is a web-app that allows for notes taking. The idea behind is to allow 
        the user utilize their local storage resources for note taking.

        App: [Link](https://prod.d2j11v9quij54i.amplifyapp.com)\
        Github: [Link](https://github.com/catfish0w0/window-note-app)

        #### Reason of doing this App
        I built this app while I was studying React for the first time. I followed a course on Scrimba 
        so that I can start building small fun frontend React App. In addition, I learnt about how 
        to use library resources to build up this App.

        #### App Features
        1. Able to create a new Note App
        2. can create, delete and change Heading of the sub-notes.
        3. Utilizes localStorage of the browser, such that it reload the notes you put in before.

        #### Design Process && Thought Process
        The Page will split into two sections, the left side would be the interactive side bar nav, and the right side
        would be the text editor for the notes. There are numerous way to achieve the same result. For example, 
        I can build a single page React component by only using React and pure CSS. But I did some research and 
        followed the course, and it is best to use some built in component from npm library, so that we do not need to
        use too much time building every functionality of the text editor from scratch.

        To achieve rendering all the notes dynamically, we need a data structure to store all the notes data we have.
        And we want it to re-render whenever we change the note taking, so the most trivial solution here
        would be using a state, and the state would hold an array of object that has the time info and notes info. 
        and since we are using react-mde package, we just need to pass in the update note function and current note tab id to it.

        To achieve staying at a specific note, we need to identify which note tab we are holding currently. One way to achieve
        this feature is to manage a state variable that keep track of which note id we are currently in. 
        Since we are mapping every note out in the sidebar nav, we can simply generate id while we create new notes.

        All other functionalities are built uponed these concepts and state management.

        #### User Journey
        Since the user has not created any notes in local storage, 
        the following screen will show up when the user first enter the URL.

        ![](:react-projects/notes/notes-app-no-notes.png){:data-align="center"}

        Later the user hit the create notes button, it will show up the side nav bar and the text editor on the screen.
